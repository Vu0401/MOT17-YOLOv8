# MOT17-YOLOv8
Overview
This project utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection tasks on the MOT17 dataset. The MOT17 dataset is designed for evaluating multiple object tracking algorithms and is sourced from the MOT Challenge, available at MOTChallenge.net.

Dataset
The MOT17 dataset includes several sequences that are provided with both detections and ground truth for training and evaluating tracking algorithms. For the purposes of this project, the focus is on the application of YOLOv8 for detecting objects in the frames provided by the dataset.
